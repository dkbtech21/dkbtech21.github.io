</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>A scale is a series of notes, played one after another, that starts on one note and ends on the note one octave higher. The distance between two notes is called an interval. Intervals are usually referred to in units of "steps". Two half steps make a whole step. To make things confusing, steps are also called tones - a whole step is the same as a tone (abbreviated T), and a half step is the same as a semitone (abbreviated S). On a guitar one fret is equal to a half step, or semitone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;An octave is a special interval in which the second note is exactly twice the frequency of the first note. If you break an octave up into 12 equal intervals of a half step each, you get the chromatic scale</P>
<P>&nbsp;The chromatic scale is the mother of all scales, since it contains all possible notes. All other scales are a subset of the chromatic scale. The difference between the scales is the intervals between their notes. In order to build a particular scale in a particular key, you need to know the key (which note to start on), and the interval pattern for that particular scale.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The other thing you need to know to build scales is that there is a whole tone between all the natural notes ("natural" meaning not sharp or flat), except between B and C and between E and F, which have a semitone between them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="Majorscale"></A>The Major Scale</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>If you pick a particular set of 7 notes from the chromatic scale, plus the octave note, you get the major scale, which is the basis of Western musical theory. The major scale intervals are:</P>
<P>&nbsp;T T S T T T S</P>
<P>&nbsp;So, the C major scale winds up being:</P>
<P>&nbsp;C D E F G A B C</P>
<P>&nbsp;The major scale in any key can be built by starting on the desired note and following the interval pattern shown above. All other major scales will have at least one sharp or flat in them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="Minorscales"></A>The Minor Scales</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The difference between major scales and minor scales is the interval between the first note of the scale and the third note. In the case of major scales, this interval is 2 tones, which has the name "major third". For minor scales, the interval is only one and a half tones, which we call a "minor third".</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>The Natural Minor Scale</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Another important scale we get by using a set of 7 notes from the chromatic scale plus the octave is the natural minor scale. The natural minor scale intervals are:</P>
<P>&nbsp;T S T T S T T</P>
<P>&nbsp;The C minor scale is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;C D Eb F G Ab Bb C</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>The Harmonic Minor Scale</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The drawback to using the natural minor scale for writing songs is the interval between the seventh note of the scale and the octave note. The major scale has a semitone between the seventh note and the octave, and it's very pleasing to the ear to hear the seventh note "resolve" to the octave. In the natural minor, the interval is a whole tone, so this sense of resolution isn't nearly as strong. The solution to the problem is to raise the seventh note of the natural minor scale by a semitone, resulting in the harmonic minor scale. The harmonic minor intervals are:</P>
<P>&nbsp;T S T T S 1.5T S</P>
<P>&nbsp;The C harmonic minor scale is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;C D Eb F G Ab B C</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>The Melodic Minor Scale</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The problem with the harmonic minor scale is that the interval between the sixth and seventh notes of the scale is one and a half tones. This makes writing melodies tough. To solve this problem, the sixth note of the scale is raised a semitone, giving us the melodic minor scale. The melodic minor intervals are:</P>
<P>&nbsp;T S T T T T S</P>
<P>&nbsp;In the key of C this is:</P>
<P>&nbsp;C D Eb F G A B C</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Traditionally, the melodic minor scale was only used when ascending, and the natural minor scale was used when descending. This rule is frequently broken in modern music, particularly in jazz.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Relative Minor Scales</P>
</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Every major scale has an associated relative minor scale. This is the natural minor scale built on the sixth note of the major scale. The sixth note of the C major scale is A, so A minor is the relative minor to the C major scale. The A minor scale is:</P>
<P>A B C D E F G</P>
<P>It's no coincidence that a major scale and its relative minor scale contain the same notes.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="Modes"></A>Modes</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>If you take the same sequence of intervals as the major scale, but you start in a different place, you wind up with what's called a mode. This is the same as using the notes of the major scale, but starting on a different note. For example, if we take the notes of the C major scale, but start on D instead of C, we get the D Dorian mode:</P>
<P>D E F G A B C D</P>
<P>The fact that the C major scale and the D Dorian mode have the same notes DOES NOT mean that they are the same scale. The notes are the same, but their relationships to each other are different. In any key, the most important note of the scale is the first note, called the tonic. In the C major scale the D note is the second note of the scale, which is relatively unimportant. In the D Dorian mode, the D note is the tonic, so it's crucial. Also, Dorian is a minor mode, since the interval between the tonic and the third note is a minor third interval. Each mode has a different set of intervals, giving it a unique melodic flavor.</P>
<P>For historical reasons, the modes are named after ancient Greek tribes. The following table lists which note of the C major scale to start on to get the corresponding mode.</P>
<P>
&nbsp;C Ionian (same as the major scale)<BR>
&nbsp;D Dorian<BR>
&nbsp;E Phrygian<BR>
&nbsp;F Lydian<BR>
&nbsp;G Mixolydian<BR>
&nbsp;A Aeolian (same as the natural minor scale)<BR>
&nbsp;B Locrian<BR>
